# Critical Fixes Applied

This document summarizes the critical issues found during code review and the fixes applied.

## Fix 1: Race Condition in Stop() ✅

**Issue**: The `Stop()` method had a race condition where the `done` channel could be closed multiple times if called concurrently, causing a panic.

**Location**: `input/impl.go:59-81`

**Problem**:
```go
func (in *inputImpl) Stop() {
    in.mu.Lock()
    if !in.started {
        in.mu.Unlock()
        return
    }
    in.started = false
    in.mu.Unlock()  // Lock released here

    close(in.done)  // But done is closed outside lock - RACE!
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `stopOnce sync.Once` to ensure single execution
- Added `stopping` flag for state tracking
- Moved cleanup inside sync.Once.Do() to guarantee atomicity

**Result**: Stop() is now truly idempotent and thread-safe. Multiple concurrent calls will not cause panics.

**Test Coverage**: Added `concurrent_test.go` with:
- `TestStopConcurrency` - 100 goroutines calling Stop() concurrently
- `TestStopAfterStart` - Validates Stop() after real Start()
- `TestMultipleStopCalls` - Sequential Stop() calls

## Fix 2: Error Handling with Backoff ✅

**Issue**: The capture loop silently ignored all non-EOF errors, potentially causing infinite CPU spin on persistent errors (terminal disconnection, permission issues, etc.).

**Location**: `input/impl.go:133-140`

**Problem**:
```go
event, err := in.backend.ReadEvent()
if err != nil {
    if err == io.EOF {
        return
    }
    // Other errors: log and continue
    continue  // Silently ignores errors - CPU spin!
}
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `consecutiveErrors` counter (max 10)
- Implemented 100ms backoff delay between errors
- Exit gracefully after 10 consecutive errors
- Reset counter on successful read

**Result**: Capture loop now handles persistent errors gracefully without spinning CPU. After 10 consecutive errors, the system shuts down cleanly.

## Fix 3: Init() Idempotency ✅

**Issue**: The `Init()` method claimed to be idempotent but wasn't truly idempotent. It would save the wrong terminal state if called after Restore().

**Location**: `input/backend_unix.go:37-92`

**Problem**:
```go
func (b *unixBackend) Init() error {
    state, err := unix.IoctlGetTermios(b.fd, unix.TIOCGETA)
    // ...
    if b.originalState == nil {
        b.originalState = state  // Saves CURRENT state (might be raw!)
    }
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `initialized bool` flag to unixBackend
- Check flag at start of Init() and return early if true
- Set flag at end of successful initialization

**Result**: Init() is now truly idempotent. Second and subsequent calls do nothing, as documented.

## Validation Results

All fixes validated with:
- ✅ All existing tests pass (12/12)
- ✅ 3 new concurrency tests added and passing
- ✅ golangci-lint: 0 issues
- ✅ go build: All packages compile
- ✅ Race detector: No races detected (go test -race)

## Remaining Known Issues (Non-Critical)

These issues were identified but not fixed in this round:

### Medium Priority
1. **Buffer allocation in hot path** (backend_unix.go:114)
   - Allocates 256 bytes per keypress
   - Recommendation: Use struct field buffer

2. **Crude escape sequence timeout** (backend_unix.go:129)
   - Always sleeps 5ms on ESC press
   - Recommendation: Rely on termios VTIME instead

3. **No UTF-8 support**
   - Only handles ASCII characters
   - Multi-byte UTF-8 creates KeyUnknown events
   - Recommendation: Add UTF-8 decoder

4. **No context support**
   - Can't cancel with context.Context
   - Recommendation: Add StartWithContext() in future version

---

## Testing Recommendations

Before production deployment:
1. Test with actual terminal (integration tests currently skip)
2. Load test with high-frequency input (gaming scenarios)
3. Test over SSH and slow terminals
4. Test terminal disconnection scenarios
5. Run with race detector: `go test -race ./...`
