# Specification Quality Checklist: GameInput Action Mapping API

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is:

- **Complete**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated
- **Technology-Agnostic**: No mention of Go, interfaces, maps, or implementation details - focuses on user needs
- **Testable**: Each requirement and success criterion is measurable and verifiable
- **Well-Scoped**: Clearly defines what's in scope (action mapping) and builds incrementally via 3 prioritized user stories
- **Independent Stories**: Each user story (P1: basic binding, P2: multiple keys, P3: rebinding) can be tested and delivered independently
- **Clear Assumptions**: Documents dependency on existing Input interface and typical usage patterns
- **Edge Cases Covered**: Identifies 7 edge cases including concurrency, empty strings, and lifecycle issues

**No Clarifications Needed**: The specification leverages existing project context (Input interface already exists) and makes reasonable defaults based on standard game development practices.

## Notes

This specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). The feature:
- Extends the existing Input system with higher-level action mapping
- Has clear priorities enabling incremental delivery (MVP = P1 only)
- Defines concrete, measurable success criteria
- Identifies all edge cases and assumptions
- Maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
