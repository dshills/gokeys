# Specification Quality Checklist: Performance and Efficiency Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality: PASS
- Specification avoids mentioning specific implementation approaches
- Focuses on performance improvements from user/developer perspective
- Edge cases and assumptions clearly documented
- All mandatory sections present and complete

### Requirement Completeness: PASS
- All 8 functional requirements are testable and specific
- Success criteria include concrete metrics (1ms latency, 50% reduction, 100% accuracy)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format consistently
- Edge cases address important failure modes (partial UTF-8, buffer reuse)
- Scope clearly defines what is and isn't included
- Dependencies on existing code and libraries documented

### Feature Readiness: PASS
- Each user story has clear acceptance criteria that can be independently tested
- Priority ordering (P1: latency, P2: memory, P3: UTF-8) reflects user impact
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No leaked implementation details (appropriate given this is an optimization feature)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- All validation items passed on first check
- Feature is well-scoped as performance improvements to existing functionality
- Clear backward compatibility requirements ensure safe implementation
