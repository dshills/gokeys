# Feature Specification: Performance and Efficiency Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-performance-issues`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "fix non-critical issues"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Reduced Input Latency (Priority: P1)

Developers building applications with the gokeys input system experience unnecessary input latency when users press the Escape key. Every Escape keypress currently adds 5 milliseconds of delay, which negatively impacts user experience in fast-paced applications like games or text editors.

**Why this priority**: Input latency directly affects user experience and is most noticeable in interactive applications. Eliminating unnecessary delays improves the responsiveness of all applications using the library.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring Escape key response time before and after the fix, and delivers immediate value by reducing latency for all applications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user presses the Escape key, **When** the system detects the keypress, **Then** the event is delivered without artificial delay
2. **Given** a user presses an escape sequence (arrow key), **When** the system reads the multi-byte sequence, **Then** the timeout is handled by terminal configuration rather than sleep

### User Story 2 - Improved Memory Efficiency (Priority: P2)

Applications using the gokeys system allocate unnecessary memory for every single keypress, creating memory pressure in high-frequency input scenarios (games running at 60+ FPS, typing applications, real-time editors). This results in increased garbage collection overhead.

**Why this priority**: Memory efficiency impacts application performance, especially in long-running applications or games. While not user-visible like latency, it affects overall system stability and responsiveness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring memory allocation rates during sustained input and verifying reduced garbage collection pressure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application receives high-frequency input, **When** processing 1000 keypresses, **Then** memory allocations are minimized compared to previous implementation
2. **Given** a game loop running at 60 FPS with continuous input, **When** monitoring memory usage, **Then** garbage collection pressure is reduced

### User Story 3 - International Character Support (Priority: P3)

Users who type in non-English languages or use special Unicode characters see their input appear as "Unknown" keys instead of the actual characters they typed. This makes the library unusable for international applications or any software requiring Unicode support.

**Why this priority**: Unicode support enables international use cases but is lower priority than performance improvements that affect all users. Applications can work around this limitation temporarily by handling printable ASCII only.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by typing international characters (Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, emoji) and verifying they are correctly captured and reported.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user types Japanese characters, **When** the input system processes the keypress, **Then** the multi-byte UTF-8 sequence is correctly decoded
2. **Given** a user types emoji characters, **When** the system receives the input, **Then** the characters are captured as proper runes instead of KeyUnknown
3. **Given** a user types mixed ASCII and Unicode, **When** processing the input stream, **Then** both character types are handled correctly

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a partial UTF-8 sequence is received (e.g., terminal disconnect mid-character)?
- How does the system handle buffer reuse when previous read was partial?
- What happens if buffer optimization introduces race conditions in concurrent access?
- How does the system perform when receiving rapid escape sequences (fast arrow key presses)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST eliminate unnecessary delays when processing Escape keypresses
- **FR-002**: System MUST use terminal configuration (VTIME) for escape sequence timeout handling
- **FR-003**: System MUST reuse read buffers to minimize memory allocation per keypress
- **FR-004**: System MUST safely handle buffer reuse without introducing data corruption or race conditions
- **FR-005**: System MUST decode multi-byte UTF-8 sequences into proper rune values
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle incomplete UTF-8 sequences gracefully without crashing
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing ASCII character handling
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality while adding UTF-8 support

### Key Entities

- **Read Buffer**: Temporary storage for terminal input bytes, reused across reads to minimize allocation
- **UTF-8 Decoder**: Stateful decoder that can accumulate partial byte sequences and emit complete runes
- **Event**: Enhanced to properly represent Unicode rune values beyond ASCII range

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Escape key response time reduces from current baseline (5ms+ sleep) to under 1ms
- **SC-002**: Memory allocations per keypress reduce by at least 50% (from 256 bytes per press)
- **SC-003**: Applications running at 60 FPS with continuous input show measurable reduction in garbage collection frequency
- **SC-004**: Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and emoji characters are correctly captured with 100% accuracy
- **SC-005**: Mixed ASCII and UTF-8 input streams are processed without corruption
- **SC-006**: System handles 10,000 consecutive UTF-8 keypresses without memory leaks or buffer corruption
- **SC-007**: All existing tests continue to pass after changes (backward compatibility maintained)
- **SC-008**: Benchmark suite shows measurable performance improvement in input processing throughput

## Scope

### In Scope

- Removing artificial sleep delay from escape sequence handling
- Optimizing buffer allocation in the read path
- Adding UTF-8 decoding capability for multi-byte characters
- Maintaining full backward compatibility with ASCII-only applications

### Out of Scope

- Context cancellation support (separate feature)
- Graphical key support (complex character composition)
- Input method editor (IME) integration
- Platform-specific character encoding beyond UTF-8
- Windows backend implementation (Unix only for this feature)

## Assumptions

- Terminal is configured with UTF-8 encoding (standard for modern terminals)
- VTIME terminal setting (100ms) is appropriate for escape sequence timeout
- Buffer size of 256 bytes is sufficient for typical UTF-8 sequences
- Developers will continue using the existing Input interface without modifications
- Performance testing will use representative workloads (60+ FPS input scenarios)

## Dependencies

- Existing Unix backend implementation (input/backend_unix.go)
- Current parser implementation (input/parser.go)
- Go's unicode/utf8 standard library package
- Existing test suite for regression validation
