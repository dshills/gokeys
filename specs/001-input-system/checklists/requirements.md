# Specification Quality Checklist: Cross-Terminal Input System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Pass 1 (2025-10-17)**:

✅ All checklist items passed on first validation

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- Specification describes WHAT the system does (normalized keyboard events, cross-platform input) not HOW
- Focused on developer experience and use cases (CLI tools, games)
- Written in terms of user scenarios and business value
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements have concrete definitions
- All 20 functional requirements are testable (can verify normalization, blocking/non-blocking behavior, platform support)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (95% accuracy, 10ms latency, 100 event buffer, 3+ platforms)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific Go packages, just capabilities)
- 6 acceptance scenarios per user story, all in Given/When/Then format
- 9 edge cases identified with expected behavior documented
- Scope clearly bounded (keyboard only, mouse/resize out of scope, initial version focus)
- Assumptions section lists 7 platform and environment assumptions

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 3 user stories cover the priority spectrum: P1 (core input), P2 (state tracking), P3 (action mapping)
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 provide measurable validation for all key capabilities
- Specification maintains abstraction level - describes Event structure conceptually without Go syntax

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if further refinement is desired.
