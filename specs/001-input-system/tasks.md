# Tasks: Cross-Terminal Input System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-input-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: TDD approach requested - tests MUST be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation (Constitution Principle IV)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single Go library**: `input/`, `internal/`, `examples/`, `tests/` at repository root
- All paths shown are absolute or relative to repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic Go module structure

- [x] T001 Create directory structure: input/, internal/backend/, internal/state/, examples/, tests/contract/, tests/integration/
- [x] T002 Initialize go.mod with module github.com/dshills/gokeys if not exists
- [x] T003 [P] Copy .golangci.yml configuration to ensure linting rules enforced
- [x] T004 [P] Create input/doc.go with package documentation per constitution

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core types and interfaces that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 [P] Define Key constants (KeyUnknown, KeyEscape, KeyEnter, KeyUp, KeyDown, KeyLeft, KeyRight, KeyA-Z, Key0-9, KeyCtrlA-Z, KeySpace, KeyF1-F12, etc.) in input/event.go
- [x] T006 [P] Define Modifier bitflags (ModNone, ModShift, ModAlt, ModCtrl) in input/event.go
- [x] T007 [P] Define Event struct (Key, Rune, Modifiers, Timestamp, Pressed, Repeat fields) in input/event.go
- [x] T008 [P] Define Input interface (Start, Stop, Poll, Next, IsPressed methods) in input/input.go
- [x] T009 [P] Define Backend interface (Init, Restore, ReadEvent methods) in internal/backend/backend.go
- [x] T010 Validate core types compile and pass golangci-lint: go build ./input && golangci-lint run ./input

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Cross-Platform (Phase 6)**: Can proceed after US1 core types exist
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Wraps US1 & US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (TDD) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (Constitution Principle IV)
- Parser before backends
- Backends before inputImpl
- Core implementation before examples
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/types within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all contract tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write contract test for escape sequence normalization in tests/contract/normalization_test.go"
Task: "Write contract test for Ctrl key normalization in tests/contract/normalization_test.go"
Task: "Write contract test for unknown sequence handling in tests/contract/normalization_test.go"

# Launch all unit tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write unit test for Event struct in input/event_test.go"
Task: "Write unit test for Modifier bitflags in input/event_test.go"
Task: "Write unit test for Poll() in input/input_test.go"
Task: "Write unit test for Next() in input/input_test.go"

# Launch parallel implementation tasks:
Task: "Implement SequenceParser in internal/backend/parser.go"
Task: "Implement UnixBackend struct in internal/backend/unix.go"
Task: "Create platform detection factory in input/input.go"
Task: "Implement inputImpl struct in input/input.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T011-T038)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

This gives you:
- ‚úÖ Basic keyboard event capture
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform normalization
- ‚úÖ Blocking (Poll) and non-blocking (Next) APIs
- ‚úÖ Terminal state restoration
- ‚úÖ Working on Unix/macOS
- ‚ùå No state tracking yet (IsPressed)
- ‚ùå No action mapping yet
- ‚ùå No Windows support yet

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (adds IsPressed)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (adds action mapping)
5. Add Windows support (Phase 6) ‚Üí Test on Windows ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (full cross-platform)
6. Add Polish (Phase 7) ‚Üí Final release
7. Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T011-T038)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T039-T061) - requires US1 types but can write tests
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T062-T080) - requires US1 types but can write tests
3. Stories integrate and validate independently
4. Team converges on Cross-Platform (Phase 6) together
5. Team converges on Polish (Phase 7) together

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- TDD mandatory: Tests MUST be written first and FAIL before implementation (Constitution)
- Run golangci-lint after each phase to catch violations early
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 106
- **Setup Phase**: 4 tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: 6 tasks
- **User Story 1**: 28 tasks (19 tests + implementation)
- **User Story 2**: 23 tasks (7 tests + implementation)
- **User Story 3**: 19 tasks (7 tests + implementation)
- **Cross-Platform**: 11 tasks
- **Polish**: 15 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 42 tasks marked [P] can run concurrently
**MVP Scope**: T001-T038 (Setup + Foundational + US1) = 38 tasks
